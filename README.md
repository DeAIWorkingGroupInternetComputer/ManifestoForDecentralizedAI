# Manifesto for Decentralized AI (DeAI)

## Preamble

In an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly central to our daily lives, this ubiquitous use of AI in applications ranging from mundane to critical tasks has powerful forces racing to establish control; the power over these transformative technologies, though, must not be confined to a few centralized entities. The Internet has brought tremendous decentralization of access to information and ease of communication, but also the centralization of power and corporate ownership of data. This trend will worsen if left unchecked. The principles of Decentralized AI (DeAI) can reverse this trend if users and application developers recognize its importance to their long-term welfare.

We envision a future where AI is democratized, broadly empowering, and adaptive to the diverse needs and values of all users, groups, and their contexts. This manifesto lays out the principles and reasons for decentralizing AI and advocates for a fair, transparent, and user-centric AI ecosystem.

## Principles of Decentralized AI

- **DeAI Is Safe AI**: DeAI prioritizes user safety by implementing robust security measures and rigorous testing protocols to minimize the risk of unintended consequences or malicious exploitation.

- **DeAI Is Self-Sovereign AI**: Users should have complete control over their AI. Your AI should work for you, reflect your values, and serve your needs without external interference.

- **DeAI Is Secure AI**: Privacy is a guarantee, not just a feature. DeAI ensures your data remains your own, safe from prying eyes and misuse.

- **DeAI Is Accessible AI**: DeAI makes advanced AI available to all. Extending the principles of the World Wide Web to AI, it is inclusive in the users it serves and in the supported interaction methods.

- **DeAI Is Participatory AI**: By allowing open contributions and attributing the created value back to the owner, DeAI enables everyone to participate in shaping the AI revolution and benefiting from it.

- **DeAI Is Responsible AI**: User empowerment and respecting stakeholdersâ€™ best interests are topmost priorities for DeAI. This includes best efforts to be resource-efficient and deliver sustainable solutions.

- **DeAI Is Verifiable AI**: Enabling thorough inspection and verification of DeAI systems promotes transparency of the underlying code and algorithms, as well as accountability to identify and rectify errors or biases in the AI's behavior.
